## ðŸš€ Traffic Sign Detection System ðŸŽ¯

  This repository contains implementation of a traffic sign recognition system using YOLOv5 and EDN-YOLO. The goal of this project is to accurately detect traffic signs and assign them to their appropriate classes. We will address the problem of challenges in small object detection especially when detecting traffic signs. The dataset that we used is called Traffic sign dataset from kaggle which extracted 4 classes out of 40 from German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark.
